Using the style of David Sedarios - tell the story of hansel and gretel

Once upon a time, in a land where the concept of child protective services was as foreign as a smartphone with a week-long battery life, there lived a brother and sister named Hansel and Gretel. They were an odd pair, both surprisingly adept at leaving trails of breadcrumbs and evading the local fitness instructor, who had made it his life's mission to get the town's children to eat kale and jog.

Their father, a humble woodcutter, had recently married a woman with a heart colder than the leftovers at a vegan potluck. One day, when the family's food supplies had dwindled to a few stale crusts of bread, the wicked stepmother concocted a plan to abandon the children in the woods, thereby ensuring her own survival and the survival of her husband's mediocre woodcutting business. She shared her nefarious scheme with her husband, who, after weighing his options, decided that his marriage vows of "for better or for worse" included being an accomplice to child abandonment.

So, one fateful morning, Hansel and Gretel were led deep into the forest by their father. Unbeknownst to him, Hansel had overheard their conversation and devised a plan of his own. The boy dropped breadcrumbs along the way, confident that the trail would lead them back home once they were abandoned. Apparently, he had never heard of the phrase "don't count your chickens before they hatch" or considered the likelihood that forest critters would turn his breadcrumbs into an all-you-can-eat buffet.

As the woodcutter bid his children farewell, his conscience pricked him like the needle on a particularly aggressive sewing machine. But, alas, he had made his choice and, with a heavy heart, left Hansel and Gretel to fend for themselves. When the time came to follow their breadcrumb trail home, the siblings discovered, to their horror, that the breadcrumbs were gone â€“ swallowed by the insatiable appetites of woodland creatures with no regard for the well-being of lost children.

Hungry, tired, and more than a little irritated by the sudden disappearance of their trail, Hansel and Gretel stumbled upon a house made entirely of candy. It was an architectural wonder, defying all logic and the basic principles of structural engineering. Ignoring the fact that houses made of candy were likely to be the lair of either witches or disgraced pastry chefs, the two siblings began to eat the house with the enthusiasm of someone who had just discovered a bottomless brunch buffet.

The house, as it turned out, belonged to a witch with a fondness for fattening up children and turning them into delectable treats. She captured Hansel and Gretel, stuffing Hansel into a cage to fatten him up, while forcing Gretel to become her unpaid intern in the dark art of gingerbread architecture.

Days turned into weeks, and Hansel's cunning plan to deceive the witch by offering her a chicken bone in place of his finger to check his plumpness worked like a charm. Meanwhile, Gretel developed a keen eye for load-bearing gumdrops and a knack for frosting-based interior design.

One day, as the witch prepared the oven to roast Hansel, Gretel seized the opportunity to use her newfound construction skills to her advantage. With the finesse of a seasoned confectionery contractor, she pushed the witch into the oven, locking the door behind her. The witch's screams were quickly drowned out by the crackling of her own gingerbread home, which had caught fire in the ensuing chaos.

With the witch defeated and their breadcrumb mishap forgiven, Hansel and Gretel led their father back to the candy house, where they feasted on its remnants like contestants in a sugar-fueled demolition derby. Their stepmother, upon hearing of their triumphant return, mysteriously vanished, presumably to join a support group for disgraced fairy tale antagonists. Hansel, Gretel, and their father returned home, vowing never to abandon each other again, and agreeing that family therapy might be in order.

The siblings used their newfound skills to open a wildly successful gingerbread house construction company, specializing in edible tiny homes for woodland creatures and the occasional eccentric billionaire. They flourished in their newfound fame, and the tale of their bravery became the stuff of legend, told around campfires and in poorly-lit taverns where the patrons had imbibed one too many flagons of mead.

And so, our story comes to an end, leaving Hansel and Gretel to live out their days in a world where candy-based construction was a booming industry, and breadcrumb trails were forever relegated to the annals of misguided navigation techniques.
