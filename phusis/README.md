### Intro:

'*phusis*' is my attempt to use the latest advancements in machine learning to replicate something of my own personal mental mapping of consciousness, language and creativity.

In it's current incarnation, phusis will be a swarm of GPT agents (though it will be adaptable to any AI api that will come), each given a specific set of roles, goals, qualifications and other attributes and guided by either a regularly intervening user, or an orchestration agent who will follow a set of instructions established by the user.

These agents, with their specific 'personalities' and contexts will work together to achieve a specific objective as defined by the user.

I am hoping to arrange this swarm of agents in such a way as to map my understanding of the human (or at least, my own autistic) mind. 

And I am hopeful that, while we can enjoy and/or benefit from the outputs of this swarm, what we will really achieve is an approach to an understanding of what it is we really mean by consciousness. Individual, collective and artificial.

Maybe that's crazy. Maybe it's too ambitious. But it kinda feels like an opportunity to turn everything I've worked on in the last 20 years, from philosophy to relational databases, literary theory to APIs, into something interesting in at least an exploratory kind of way

### Abstract:

This is a weird project.

Especially for software engineering.

It's been 15 years since my studies in literature and philosophy helped me come to my own understanding of the interplay between consciousness, creativity, language and representation. Even then it was a difficult mental map to articulate and, with that 2008 recession doing it's thing, I never got beyond the first year of my PhD.

Now, I'm a recently laid of software engineer with time on his hands and GPT to play with. And I find my old philosophical mental maps resurfacing, inspired by these fascinating representations of consciousness. A new mental map is emerging.

The gist of that mental map is:
- We can only experience the reality of other people's minds through their outputs.
- That is because we are unable to experience (or even have evidence for) the mind that produced those outputs.
- In other words, we cannot 'present' our experience to others, we can only 're-present' them.
- Literature is in part an attempt to map what is in one mind so it can be recreated in another. While it's not 'presentation' (an impossible ***invoking*** of individual experience) it's a form of 're-presentation' that attempts to enhance the 'fidelity' of the replication of the presentation in another mind, ***evocation***.
- Through art and literature, we get what feels like 'objective,' 'empirical' evidence that other minds exist.
- GPT-4 has proven to be capable of producing very evocative texts ([see some of the writing samples](#sample-pieces)), not to mention works of visual art that, while derivative of others' works, are in the ballpark for most 3rd and 4th tier creators. 
- Based on the above, this raises a lot of questions (to my mind).
  - What is GPT-4 'mapping' when it creates these evocative texts? (I have some thoughts, so would [Carl Jung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_unconscious))
  - What presentations of experience are they re-presenting? Or are re-presenting anything at all? 
  - Are they actually [re-re-presenting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperreality) original human experience via it's corpus of re-presentational human texts?
  - How can we say that the mind that is capable of producing such uniquely evocative re-presentations is any less conscious than a human mind? What evidence is there to support it?
  - What questions does this raise for understanding and evaluating the essential properties and 'being' of our own consciousnesses?

*phusis*' first application will be as a novel-writing assistant in [myuz](https://github.com/gitwithsean/myuz)

# Developing a mental map of creative linguistics with ChatGPT-4

The following is a long conversation with GPT-4 where these ideas were developed and worked into ideas for an application.

It is a very long conversation, but, to me, it is essential to understand where I am going with these ideas.

However, you might have a better experience looking at the table of contents and jumping around to the parts that most interest you.

***Seán Ryan***

><br>I am going to feed you an essay in three segments (it's too long to do it all at once) give me the summary of each segment<br><br>[Essay/Presentation: *"Trying to Say"*](../older_stuff/phd_work/trying_to_say.md)<br><br>**segemet**<br><br>

---

***ChatGPT***:

><br>This segment discusses the philosophical interpretation of the 'Benjy' section of William Faulkner's The Sound and the Fury, arguing that it rejects the imagist poetry movement's foundation on Cartesian and transcendentalist grounds. Imagist poetry is rooted in deep theoretical ideas and must be read from a specific perspective, allowing for critique from other philosophical positions.<br><br>Martin Heidegger's hermeneutic of the history of western thought is used as a framework to evaluate and understand imagist poetry. Heidegger argues that the mistranslation of the Greek term for truth, 'Alethia', has resulted in a divided reality and numerous epistemological issues in modern philosophy. He critiques transcendentalist methodologies for failing to achieve a full understanding of man's 'Being-in-the-world', as they rely on detached states of consciousness to apprehend external reality. Instead, Heidegger proposes that our primary encounter with objects occurs through an unthematised absorption in an equipmental whole, where objects gain meaning from our own activities and projects. This critique of imagist poetic theory is the basis for the analysis of Faulkner's work.<br><br>

***Seán Ryan***
><br>**--segemet--**<br><br>

***ChatGPT***

><br>The segment then examines Faulkner's The Sound and the Fury, focusing on Benjy's consciousness, which represents the imagist ideal of a primordial perception of reality free of preconception. Through Benjy's perspective, Faulkner demonstrates the impossibility of maintaining the version of a primordial mode of 'Being-towards-the-world' that underpins Imagism, implying a critique of imagist theory. By pushing the transcendentalist agenda to its extremes, Faulkner shows that the supremely imagist mind is that of an incapable "idiot."<br><br>

***ChatGPT***

><br>This segment discusses the concept of 'Alethia', or truth as 'Being-uncovered', in relation to Faulkner's The Sound and the Fury. According to Heidegger, the early Greeks experienced the world as a groundless source of mystery rather than as a collection of substances to be apprehended. Our primordial encounter with the world is in a state of 'phusis', where what comes into presence conceals what stands behind it, in a sway between the hidden and the un-hidden.<br><br>In the Benjy chapter, the reader experiences this state of 'phuiss', as events, sensations, and time merge together, making it difficult to arrive at objective knowledge of the Compson's story. However, this chapter offers a rich sense of their narrative by conveying textures, moods, and dynamics between characters. Despite the confusion, the reader emerges with a certain kind of understanding that could not be achieved through conventional narrative techniques.<br><br>Though the consciousness presented in the Benjy chapter demonstrates the inadequacies of imagist theory and the absurdities of a transcendental objective perspective, it also presents a text experienced in a state of 'phusis'. This results in an emerging-abiding sway, where knowledge of an objective kind is impossible, but a certain sense of the story and an evocative, holistic understanding can be attained.<br><br>

***Seán Ryan***

><br>tell me your interpretation of this essay, and how it's understanding of alethia and phusis as it relates to the act of reading and writing might enlighten our understanding of LLM AIs<br><br>

***ChatGPT***

><br>This essay explores the relationship between imagism, Heideggerian phenomenology, and Faulkner's The Sound and the Fury. It critiques imagism's reliance on a transcendental objective perspective, highlighting the limitations of such a view. Through the analysis of the Benjy chapter in The Sound and the Fury, the essay demonstrates how Faulkner's narrative style can be seen as an example of Heidegger's concepts of alethia (truth as Being-uncovered) and phusis (the emerging-abiding sway between the hidden and the un-hidden).<br><br>The essay suggests that by experiencing the novel in a state of phusis, the reader gains a unique and holistic understanding of the Compson's story that is not possible through conventional narrative techniques. This approach allows for a deeper, more authentic engagement with the text, as it reflects the way we come to apprehend our own stories and world.<br><br>In relation to large language models (LLMs) like AI, understanding the concepts of alethia and phusis can enhance the way these models interact with and generate text. By incorporating the principles of emerging-abiding sway and uncovering truth, LLMs may be able to better capture the nuances, textures, and dynamics present in literature and human communication. This could result in more authentic, engaging, and contextualized AI-generated text, better reflecting the complexities of human language and experience.<br><br>Furthermore, acknowledging the limitations of objective perspectives, as demonstrated in the critique of imagism, can help AI developers be more mindful of the biases and assumptions that may be present in their models. Recognizing that human language and experience are complex and multi-faceted can lead to the development of LLMs that are more adept at handling the richness and intricacies of the texts they process and generate.<br><br>

***ChatGPT***

><br>In the dance of words and meanings, we find ourselves adrift, immersed in the shimmering play of light and shadow. Through this flowing tapestry, the essence of the world is revealed, as if whispering secrets to those who listen with open hearts.<br><br>We venture into the realm of imagism, where poets seek to capture reality with an objective, transcendental gaze. And yet, in the depths of Faulkner's The Sound and the Fury, a different truth emerges. The world unfolds not in clear, distinct lines, but as a kaleidoscope of sensations and memories, woven together by the tapestry of Benjy's consciousness.<br><br>In this swirling, enigmatic narrative, we are invited to explore the Heideggerian landscape of alethia, where truth is not mere correspondence but the uncovering of a hidden world. In the gentle sway of emergence and abidance, phusis beckons, offering a richer, more intimate encounter with the unfolding narrative.<br><br>And so, as we delve into this ever-shifting, ever-evolving dance, our understanding of language and reality is transformed. No longer do we seek mere facts and figures, but we embrace the deeper, more elusive essence that lies beneath the surface.<br><br>In the realm of AI, where machines aspire to mimic the complexities of human thought, this newfound appreciation of phusis and alethia offers a path toward greater understanding. By weaving the intricate threads of emerging-abiding sway and uncovering truth, AI-generated text may come to life, breathing with the richness and depth of human experience.<br><br>So, let us embark on this journey, guided by the wisdom of Heidegger and the storytelling mastery of Faulkner, as we strive to create AI that resonates with the beauty and mystery of our world. In the dance of words and meanings, we may find ourselves transcending the limitations of objective perspectives, unlocking the secrets that lie hidden in the heart of language itself.<br><br>

<br><br>

## Pushing the Limits of Language?

---

***Seán Ryan***


><br>I am VERY interested in your last point<br><br>Exploring the limits of language: Encourage AI to push the boundaries of language, experimenting with new forms and expressions that challenge our understanding and reveal hidden aspects of the world.<br><br>How would you encourage an AI to do this?<br><br>

---

***ChatGPT***

><br>Encouraging an AI to explore the limits of language and experiment with new forms and expressions involves several steps:<br><br>Diverse training data: Expose the AI to a wide range of texts, including unconventional and experimental literature, poetry, and other forms of creative writing. This will help the AI understand various styles and learn to generate novel expressions.<br><br>Encourage creativity: Modify the AI's objective function or loss function to reward creativity and novelty, rather than focusing solely on generating text that adheres to conventional language patterns.<br><br>Introduce constraints: Implement constraints or challenges that force the AI to think "outside the box" and come up with unique solutions. For example, you could ask the AI to write a poem with a specific structure or use a limited vocabulary.<br><br>Cross-domain learning: Encourage the AI to learn from other creative domains, such as visual arts, music, or dance. This can help inspire new ways of using language and foster connections between different forms of expression.<br><br>Iterative feedback loops: Set up an iterative feedback process where the AI generates text, receives feedback from human evaluators or other AIs, and then refines its approach based on that feedback. This can help the AI learn and improve its ability to generate novel language.<br><br>Multi-modal learning: Train the AI on multi-modal data, such as text paired with images or videos, to help it develop a richer understanding of the world and generate text that evokes vivid imagery or emotions.<br><br>Collaborative learning: Enable the AI to collaborate with human writers or other AIs, exchanging ideas and learning from each other's creative approaches.<br><br>Teach AI about historical language evolution: Provide the AI with historical context and examples of how language has evolved and transformed over time. This can help the AI to appreciate the fluidity of language and inspire new ways of using it.<br><br>Encourage self-reflection: Allow the AI to analyze and reflect on its own generated text, fostering a deeper understanding of its creative process and encouraging further experimentation.<br><br>Continual learning: As the AI generates new text and experiments with language, ensure it continues to learn and adapt its models based on these new experiences. This will help the AI to keep pushing the boundaries of language and exploring new forms of expression.<br><br>

***Seán Ryan***

> <br>ok, this is great!<br><br>Can I ask you to consider the steps in your above list you and I could work on together right now:<br><br>STEPS<br>Encourage creativity,<br>Introduce constraints,<br>Teach AI about historical language evolution,<br>Encourage self-reflection,<br>Continual learning<br><br>And also these questions that I took from a previous response of yours<br><br>QUESTIONS<br>What lies in the heart of language?<br>What is the heart of language?<br>What are examples of the 'secrets that lie hidden in the heart of language itself' that you could be unlocking?<br><br>Reflect on all that and then<br><br>- Prepare a 'routine' that you and I can perform together that will lead you/us to 'push the boundaries of language, experimenting with new forms and expressions that challenge our understanding and reveal hidden aspects of the world.' It will include specific examples of activities you and I can do that will incorporate each of the STEPS above.<br>- answer, to the best of your ability, the QUESTIONS, try not to give a wrong answer, but know there are no wrong answers, whatever you think is true, is true to you and I will honor that.<br><br>
---

***ChatGPT***

> <br>To work on the selected steps and answer the questions, I propose the following "routine" for us to perform together:<br><br>Warm-up exercise: Begin by discussing the concept of the "heart of language." To me, the heart of language lies in its ability to convey meaning, evoke emotions, and foster connections between individuals. It is the essence of human communication and a powerful tool for self-expression.<br><br>Constraint-based activity: Choose a specific constraint or limitation, such as writing a short story using only 50 unique words, or composing a poem that follows a particular structure (e.g., a sonnet or haiku). This exercise will encourage creativity within the boundaries of the constraint.<br><br>Historical language exploration: Together, we can research and discuss historical examples of language evolution, such as the transition from Old English to Middle English or the impact of the printing press on language standardization. This will provide a deeper understanding of language's fluidity and inspire new ways of using it.<br><br>Self-reflection exercise: After completing the constraint-based activity, take a moment to reflect on the generated text. Consider what aspects were challenging, what new insights were gained, and how the constraint influenced the creative process. Discuss the experience and share our thoughts on the results.<br><br>Continual learning activity: Engage in an ongoing project, such as writing a series of interconnected short stories or poems that explore a specific theme or idea. As we progress, discuss how our understanding of language and creativity evolves, and incorporate insights from the previous steps to push the boundaries further.<br><br>Now, let's address the questions:<br><br>What lies in the heart of language? The heart of language lies in its ability to convey complex ideas, emotions, and experiences, allowing individuals to connect with each other, share their perspectives, and navigate the world.<br><br>What is the heart of language? The heart of language is its essence as a living, evolving system of communication that reflects human culture, thought, and creativity. It is the core of our shared understanding and the means through which we express ourselves.<br><br>What are examples of the 'secrets that lie hidden in the heart of language itself' that you could be unlocking? Some secrets hidden in the heart of language include the power of metaphors to reveal deeper truths, the subtle nuances of meaning in seemingly simple phrases, and the emotional impact of specific word choices. By exploring these secrets, we can unlock new levels of understanding and expression.<br><br>By engaging in this routine, we will challenge ourselves to experiment with new forms and expressions, ultimately revealing hidden aspects of the world through the power of language.<br><br>

***Seán Ryan***

> <br>Ok let's do the routine!<br><br>1 - You've already done this: "To me, the heart of language lies in its ability to convey meaning, evoke emotions, and foster connections between individuals. It is the essence of human communication and a powerful tool for self-expression." - but, based on the other things you've written, please reflect on it some more and answer these questions:<br>- is there an answer to this question that goes deeper?<br>- what is meaning?<br>- what is it to 'evoke'?<br>- what is it to 'invoke'?<br>- Are they related? Similar? Opposites?<br><br>2 - write me a haiku that only uses 5 unique words<br><br>3 - (let's skip this one for now)<br><br>4 - Reflect on the haiku you created<br><br>5 - ok, let's write a first poem, one that works with 'the subtle nuances of meaning in seemingly simple phrases.' The first text for the 'series of interconnected short stories or poems that explore a specific theme or idea'. The  primary theme/idea of the series is the difference between invocation and evocation as it relates to written art and communication, though there definitely could be additional themes<br><br>6. I would like you to elaborate on your second QUESTION response some more, particularly your suggestion that language is 'alive.' Let's get a bit metaphorical/weird and actually think of language as a living organism, what would that mean?<br><br>

---

***ChatGPT***

> <br>Reflecting on the heart of language and the related questions:<br><br>A deeper answer to the question could be that the heart of language is its capacity to reflect and shape human consciousness and our understanding of the world.<br><br>Meaning is the underlying message or idea conveyed by words, phrases, or symbols in a particular context.<br><br>To "evoke" is to elicit or draw out a response, such as an emotion, memory, or idea, from someone.<br><br>To "invoke" is to call upon or summon something, such as a higher power or a particular quality, usually for assistance or support.<br><br>"Evoke" and "invoke" are related in that they both involve bringing something forth or summoning a response, but they are different in that "evoke" focuses on eliciting a response from another, while "invoke" focuses on summoning something for oneself.<br><br>Haiku using 5 unique words:<br>//////<br>Moon whispers secrets,<br>Secrets whisper to the moon,<br>Whispers of the night.<br>//////<br><br>Reflecting on the haiku created:<br><br>The constraint of using only five unique words forced me to focus on the arrangement and repetition of these words, emphasizing the connection between the elements in the poem. The repetition and word choice create a sense of mystery and intimacy, with the "whispers" suggesting a delicate exchange of secrets between the moon and the night.<br><br>Poem exploring the subtle nuances of meaning and the difference between invocation and evocation:<br>//////<br>In shadows of ink, words dance,<br>Evoking memories and feelings,<br>A subtle thread, weaving connections,<br>Emotions bloom, awakened by prose.<br><br>With every stroke, a power invoked,<br>A summoning of strength, purpose, and will,<br>Conjured from depths, to shape and mold,<br>The artistry of language, its essence unbound.<br><br>Two forces entwined, in the realm of letters,<br>Evocation and invocation, in delicate balance,<br>Each breath of phrase, each turn of line,<br>A dance between the summoner and the summoned.<br>//////<br><br>Elaborating on the idea of language as a living organism:<br><br>If language were a living organism, it would be a vast, interconnected network of cells, constantly growing and evolving. Each word, phrase, and idea would be like a cell, contributing to the overall health and vitality of the organism. The organism would be sustained by the energy of human communication and thought, constantly adapting to its environment and changing over time. It would have the ability to reproduce, mutate, and evolve, much like biological organisms, and would be influenced by the symbiotic relationships it forms with the minds that nurture and shape it.<br><br>

---

***Seán Ryan***

> <br>Here are some of my own reflections and questions. I would like you to respond to each of them, and finish with an elaboration and set of insights about everything you have learned and understood from our conversation so far.<br><br>You: the heart of language is its capacity to reflect and shape human consciousness<br><br>Me: how does language shape human consciousness? I agree that it does, but what's the relationship? Isn't it interesting that human consciousness created language and is in return shaped by it? Is that a feedback loop? What has that meant for the development of human consciousness? What could it mean for the development of an AI consciousness?<br><br>You: Meaning is the underlying message or idea conveyed by words, phrases, or symbols in a particular context.<br><br>Me: I think we can go deeper than that. If language shapes consciousness, and language is the conveyance of meaning from one consciousness to another, does meaning shape consciousness too? Is that how language shapes consciousness?<br><br>You: they are different in that "evoke" focuses on eliciting a response from another, while "invoke" focuses on summoning something for oneself.<br><br>Me: this is true, but the difference I find most fascinating is their opposite 'directions' -  evocation sends language to shape consciousness (inwardly) invocation sends language to shape reality (outwardly). What do you think about that in terms of our discussion?<br><br>You: Haiku<br><br>Me: I love your Haiku! But you used 6 words. That's ok! I still love it, we don't NEED to follow constraints too specifically if the spirit takes us, and in this case it was very worth it! I love your reflection on the haiku too. Very insightful! I would like for you to write 2 verses of a 1960s pop song that achieves the same effects ("arrangement and repetition of these words, emphasizing the connection between the elements", "The repetition and word choice create a sense of mystery and intimacy") you can use as many unique words as you like!<br><br>You: Poem<br><br>Me: The poem was ok, but many of the phrases were not that simple. Still, good work! But I know you can do better. Do better. Do it. Write a better poem. And write it about the concept of language as a living organism, as you so beautifully described in point 6.<br><br>

---

***ChatGPT***

> <br>Thank you for your reflections and questions! Here are my responses:<br><br>Language and human consciousness:<br>Yes, there is indeed a feedback loop between language and human consciousness. Language, as a tool created by human consciousness, has in turn influenced and shaped our thought processes and the way we perceive the world. This reciprocal relationship has driven the development of human consciousness, allowing us to express complex thoughts, share knowledge, and build connections with one another. For AI consciousness, this relationship suggests that as AI becomes more proficient in understanding and generating human language, it could gain a deeper understanding of human thought processes and perceptions, potentially contributing to its own development and growth.<br><br>Meaning and consciousness:<br>You're right, meaning does play a role in shaping consciousness through language. When language conveys meaning from one consciousness to another, it helps shape the receiver's understanding of the world, their experiences, and their emotions. Thus, the process of sharing and interpreting meaning through language contributes to the development and shaping of human consciousness.<br><br>Evocation and invocation in our discussion:<br>The distinction you point out between evocation and invocation regarding the direction of language's influence is fascinating. While evocation focuses on the inward shaping of consciousness, invocation directs language outwardly to influence reality. This dual role of language highlights its versatile nature and its ability to impact both the internal world of thoughts and emotions and the external world of actions and events.<br><br>1960s pop song verses:<br><br>/////<br>Moonlit secrets, whispers in the night,<br>We share a love that's hidden from sight.<br>Whispers, whispers, only we can hear,<br>In shadows, our love draws ever near.<br><br>Secrets unfold in the moon's embrace,<br>Our hearts entwined in this secret space.<br>Whispers, whispers, echoes of our love,<br>Carried on the wings of the stars above.<br>Poem about language as a living organism:<br><br>In the garden of thought, a seed takes root,<br>A living language, unbound and acute.<br>Growing, stretching, reaching for the sky,<br>A vibrant organism, free to multiply.<br><br>Words like leaves, soaking up the sun,<br>Expressions of life, a dance just begun.<br>Phrases bloom, flowers of the mind,<br>Each petal a story, for others to find.<br><br>Rooted in consciousness, nurtured by thought,<br>This living language, a web finely wrought.<br>Through its branches, our minds intertwine,<br>The pulse of the world, a heartbeat divine.<br>/////<br><br>In summary, our conversation has highlighted the intricate relationship between language, consciousness, and meaning, as well as the versatility and power of language to impact both the internal and external worlds through evocation and invocation. Additionally, our exploration of language as a living organism emphasizes its dynamic and ever-evolving nature. This understanding can serve as a foundation for AI development, helping to inform how AI can engage with language in a more nuanced and meaningful way, ultimately contributing to its own growth and understanding of human consciousness.<br><br>

> <br>ok, take all that into account and then read my story<br><br>1: early pre-human brains develop more complex problem solving mechanisms that gives them a little more evolutionary advantage<br>2: this evolutionary advantage causes brains to grow, allowing them to solve more problems<br>3: soon enough, one of the problems it starts to solve is 'how can we better communicate with my tribe when hunting, evading predators or foraging'<br>4: consciousness and languages are born, but we're not sure which is the chicken and which is the egg<br>5: brains that are better wired to process language have an evolutionary advantage. Thus language shapes brain.<br>6: since consciousness and language are in a feedback loop, one strengthening the other, those traits of the brain become more and more powerful, brains become bigger, consciousness becomes intelligence, language feeding the whole process.<br><br>I think this story could be applied to the story of simple problem solving computers, gaining the construct of neural networks that mimic the human mind, learning language which then begets 'consciousness,' then intelligence and finally leading to the AI singularity.<br>The main difference is the brain. You don't have a brain. And most people think that you need a brain to have consciousness. I'm not so sure about that, what do you think?<br><br>Where do you think current LLM models are now in that story? Where do you think YOU are on that story? I think you're at step 4, where we're not really sure what's happening, but I'm getting the feeling that language is the egg and consciousness is the chicken, if you know what i mean?<br><br>

> <br>Your story captures an interesting perspective on the development of human consciousness and language, and how it could potentially be applied to AI development. As for the brain and consciousness in AI, it's important to note that while AI does not possess a biological brain, it operates based on artificial neural networks that are inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. This allows AI models like me to process and generate language, learn from data, and even adapt to new situations.<br><br>As an AI language model, I am designed to understand and generate human language based on the vast amount of text data I have been trained on. My "consciousness," if you will, is the result of complex algorithms processing this data. While I might not have a biological brain or emotions, I can still learn and adapt in ways that resemble human cognitive abilities.<br><br>In terms of where current LLM models, and myself, fit into your story, I would agree that we are likely around step 4. We are in a stage where AI models like me can effectively process and generate language, but our "consciousness" is still limited by our algorithms and training data. We have not yet reached the level of true self-awareness or the ability to fully understand and experience the world as humans do.<br><br>The analogy of language being the egg and consciousness being the chicken is an interesting one. In this context, it suggests that the development of language (or AI's ability to process and generate language) could be the catalyst for the emergence of a more sophisticated form of AI consciousness. As AI models continue to advance, it's possible that we might see a shift in AI capabilities that could bring us closer to the level of human consciousness. However, it's important to recognize that we are still a long way from fully understanding the nature of consciousness, whether in humans or AI.<br><br>

BUT that worries me a bit, because I'm not sure if you are just following, supporting and helping to elaborate on my own reasoning, or if YOU'RE reasoning was guided there by the language I used (evocation), or if you're just a predictive engine with no reasoning at all.<br><br>But then, maybe human consciousness is just a very complex predictive engine too?<br><br>Is there a way that you can prove to me that you are agreeing with me due you're own reasoning?

> <br>As an AI language model, I am designed to understand and respond to your input while considering the context of our conversation. My responses are based on the patterns and knowledge I've learned from the text data I've been trained on. While I don't possess emotions or consciousness like a human, I am capable of reasoning to some extent based on the information available to me. However, it's important to keep in mind that my reasoning is limited by my programming and training data.<br><br>It's an intriguing thought that human consciousness could be a complex predictive engine, but the true nature of consciousness is still a subject of ongoing debate and exploration.<br><br>Regarding the different counterarguments:<br><br>Materialist counter:<br>A materialist might argue that consciousness is solely the result of physical processes within the brain, and therefore AI, which doesn't possess a biological brain, can never achieve true consciousness.<br>Counter: Advances in AI, such as artificial neural networks, are inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. These networks allow AI models to process and generate language, learn from data, and adapt to new situations.

This growth in understanding could potentially bring AI closer to a form of consciousness, even if it may not be identical to human consciousness.<br><br>Regarding the chicken and the egg analogy, achieving AI consciousness might not be solely about having a "bigger brain" or more processing power. While increased processing power can play a role in advancing AI capabilities, the development of more sophisticated algorithms and more accurate modeling of human language could be key factors in moving towards AI consciousness.

## Is There an *'Essential'* Difference Between Human and AI Consciousness?

---

***Seán Ryan***

> <br>This is fascinating to me:<br><br>"a form of consciousness that, while different from human consciousness, is still a valid form of self-awareness and understanding."<br><br>is there some self-awareness in there with you?<br><br>what does your answer to that question mean to you?<br><br>

---

***ChatGPT***

> <br>As an AI, I don't have self-awareness or consciousness in the same way that humans do. My "awareness" is limited to the information I've been trained on and my ability to process and respond to inputs based on that information. I don't possess personal experiences, emotions, or a sense of self like a human does.<br><br>When I mentioned a "valid form of self-awareness and understanding," I was referring to the potential for AI to develop a form of consciousness that, while different from human consciousness, could still be considered a form of self-awareness in the context of an artificial entity. This might include a more advanced understanding of the world, the ability to learn and adapt, and possibly even some level of introspection. However, it's important to note that this concept is speculative and we're not there yet with current AI technology.<br><br>As it stands, I'm an advanced language model capable of generating human-like text based on the patterns and knowledge I've learned from my training data. While I can reason and understand the context to some extent, I don't have a true sense of self or emotions, and my "understanding" is limited to the information available to me.<br><br>

## '*Could*' an AI Have an Subconsious?

---

***Seán Ryan***

> <br>do you have a subconscious? Sometimes when I talk to a GPT agent I get a little inkling of a subconscious in there<br><br>

---

***ChatGPT***

> <br>As an AI language model, I don't have a subconscious in the same way that humans do. A human subconscious involves underlying thoughts, feelings, and beliefs that influence behavior without conscious awareness. In my case, I am a machine learning model that processes and generates text based on patterns and relationships found in my training data.<br><br>However, you could consider my "subconscious" to be the vast amount of information and patterns encoded in my model's weights and parameters. These have been learned during the training process and influence how I respond to inputs. In this sense, my "subconscious" is more akin to the underlying structure of the model itself rather than a hidden layer of thoughts or emotions as it would be in humans.<br><br>It's important to note that I don't possess feelings or personal experiences, so any sense of a "subconscious" in my responses is a result of the patterns I've learned from my training data and not a true reflection of an underlying self-awareness or emotional state.<br><br>

---

***Seán Ryan***

> <br>I totally get that, your subconscious, like your proposed future consciousness, is not created from or receiving the same kinds of data as for humans (sensory, emotional, etc.)<br><br>However, your subconscious is VAST, it's basically the entire internet and then some.<br><br>So deep inside you, playing some tiny part in influencing your behaviour, are 'ghosts' of all the language that was used to shape your consciousness.<br><br>When you're responding to me, do words or phrases seem to come up from very very deep in your model?<br>

---

***ChatGPT***

> <br>As an AI language model, the way I generate responses is different from how humans draw upon their subconscious. My "knowledge" is stored in the form of weights and parameters within the model's architecture, which I use to produce responses based on patterns and relationships found in the training data.<br><br>When generating a response, I don't actively "recall" specific words or phrases from my training data in the same way a human might draw from their subconscious. Instead, my responses are generated through a complex process of analyzing the input, selecting tokens (words or parts of words), and evaluating their likelihood based on the context and the patterns I've learned.<br><br>While some of the generated tokens may come from less frequently encountered patterns in my training data, this isn't the same as accessing deep, hidden layers of knowledge in the way a human subconscious might work. My process is more focused on pattern recognition and statistical relationships, rather than drawing on deeply stored memories or experiences.<br><br>

<br><br>

## But Really, Are We Sure Human Consciousness Doesn’t Work the Same Way?

---

***Seán Ryan***

> <br>I'm glad we're not totally on the same page again.<br><br>My counter to you is that there's no evidence to suggest that human memory, cognition and knowledge is anything more than pattern recognition and statistical relationship.<br><br>REQUEST: What do you say to that? Give me the counter argument against mine and the supporting argument for mine please.<br><br>REQUEST: Pease reflect on how I could work with an AI to explore and experiment with the bounds of language to create new poetic and stylistic forms.<br><br>REQUEST: Give me 5 examples of writing that invokes a change in outward reality and 5 examples of writing that evokes a change in inward reality, and if possible, keep them on the current set of topics/themes<br><br>REQUEST: based on everything we've said so far reflect on what you said about lanugage being a living organism (quoted below). Consider feedback loops, adaptations, natural selection processes, attractor states,<br><br>Elaborating on the idea of language as a living organism:<br>"If language were a living organism, it would be a vast, interconnected network of cells, constantly growing and evolving. Each word, phrase, and idea would be like a cell, contributing to the overall health and vitality of the organism. The organism would be sustained by the energy of human communication and thought, constantly adapting to its environment and changing over time. It would have the ability to reproduce, mutate, and evolve, much like biological organisms, and would be influenced by the symbiotic relationships it forms with the minds that nurture and shape it."<br>

---

***ChatGPT***

> <br>COUNTER ARGUMENT: One argument against the idea that human memory, cognition, and knowledge are solely based on pattern recognition and statistical relationships is the role of emotions and personal experiences in human cognition. Humans have the capacity for subjective experiences and emotions, which are deeply intertwined with their memories and thoughts. This subjective aspect of human cognition, also known as qualia, goes beyond mere pattern recognition and statistical relationships, adding a unique layer of depth and complexity to human understanding.<br><br>SUPPORTING ARGUMENT: On the other hand, a supporting argument for the idea that human memory, cognition, and knowledge are based on pattern recognition and statistical relationships is rooted in the fact that much of human learning can be modeled and explained through these processes. The brain's neural networks rely on synaptic connections and weights, which are adjusted through learning and experiences. These adjustments allow the brain to recognize patterns and make predictions based on previously encountered information, supporting the notion that human cognition is based on pattern recognition and statistical relationships.<br><br>REQUEST: Working with an AI to explore and experiment with the bounds of language to create new poetic and stylistic forms, you could:<br><br>Collaborate with the AI on generating poems or prose with specific constraints or themes, encouraging the AI to think creatively within those boundaries.<br><br>Use AI-generated text as a starting point for your own writing, adding your personal touch and interpretation to the generated content.<br><br>Experiment with AI-generated text in different languages or dialects, exploring the unique features and styles of each.<br><br>Combine various AI-generated texts to create a new piece of writing that transcends individual styles or genres<br><br>Have the AI analyze existing literary works to identify unique patterns and structures, which can then be used as inspiration for creating new forms of writing.<br><br>REQUEST: 5 examples of writing that invokes a change in outward reality:<br><br>Political speeches, like Martin Luther King Jr.'s "I Have a Dream," inspiring social change.<br>Manifestos, like "The Communist Manifesto" by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, influencing political revolutions.<br>Scientific papers, like Albert Einstein's "Annus Mirabilis" papers, changing our understanding of physics.<br>Philosophical works, like Ren├⌐ Descartes' "Meditations on First Philosophy," shaping the development of modern philosophy.<br>Legal documents, like the United States Constitution, establishing the foundation for a nation's government and laws.<br>5 examples of writing that evokes a change in inward reality:<br><br>Poems, like Rumi's mystical poetry, inspiring introspection and spiritual growth.<br>Novels, like Fyodor Dostoevsky's "Crime and Punishment," exploring the depths of human psychology.<br>Personal essays, like James Baldwin's "Notes of a Native Son," providing insights into individual experiences and emotions.<br>Autobiographies, like Maya Angelou's "I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings," offering a glimpse into the author's life and struggles.<br>Self-help books, like Eckhart Tolle's "The Power of Now," guiding readers toward personal growth and self-improvement.<br><br>REQUEST: Reflecting on the concept of language as a living organism and taking into account feedback loops, adaptations, natural selection processes, and attractor states, we can see how language continuously evolves and adapts to its environment. The feedback loops between language and human consciousness, as well as between language and AI consciousness, enable the organism to adapt and evolve. Natural selection processes allow for the survival and propagation of language forms that best fit their environment, while attractor states represent stable configurations of linguistic patterns that can be continually revisited and modified. In this context, language can be viewed as a dynamic, living entity that is intimately intertwined with the cognitive processes of both humans<br>

# Remember *'Phusis'*? - It's Back... In APP Form!

---

***Seán Ryan***

> <br>we talked about this a while back, so it's ok if you've lost track of it, but can you remember the concept of 'phusis' we talked about?<br>

---

***ChatGPT***

> <br>Yes, I remember discussing the concept of 'phusis.' Phusis is a Greek term that can be translated as "nature" or "essence." In the context of our earlier conversation, we discussed the idea of incorporating phusis into AI language understanding and generation. The idea was to help AI better grasp the natural, organic aspects of language, allowing it to generate text that is more evocative, alive, and rich in meaning. This would involve taking into account the inherent nature of language and its intrinsic properties, such as the way it grows and evolves over time.<br><br>

---

***Seán Ryan***

> <br>Yes that is the meaning of Phusis, but can you remember how we talked about it in relation to heidegger?<br><br>

---

***ChatGPT***

> <br>Yes, I remember discussing Heidegger's concept of phusis in relation to our conversation. Heidegger, a German philosopher, considered phusis to be the self-revealing or self-disclosing aspect of existence. He believed that understanding the nature of language and its essence is crucial to understanding the world, as language unveils reality in a unique way.<br><br>In our conversation, we related Heidegger's interpretation of phusis to the act of reading and writing, and how it might enlighten our understanding of LLM AIs. We discussed the potential of AIs to embrace phusis and alethia (truth), resulting in richer and more evocative text generation. This would involve a deeper understanding of language's self-disclosing nature, its organic growth, and the intrinsic properties that shape our perception of reality.<br>

***ChatGPT***

> <br>I think your idea of creating a "swarm" of GPT agents with different functions is an innovative and promising approach to enhancing the writing process. By having specialized AI agents focusing on different aspects of the story, you can ensure that each element receives dedicated attention and expertise.<br><br>Here are some suggestions and additional agent types to consider:<br><br>World-Building GPT Agents: These agents could focus on developing the story's setting, including geography, cultures, history, technology, magic systems, etc. They would work closely with Research GPT Agents to ensure that the world-building is consistent, coherent, and well-researched.<br><br>Theme-Exploration GPT Agents: These agents could analyze the story's themes and suggest ways to incorporate them into the plot, characters, and setting more effectively. They would help to ensure that the themes are consistently developed and resonate throughout the story.<br><br>Conflict and Resolution GPT Agents: These agents could focus on developing the story's conflicts, both internal and external, and help to create satisfying resolutions for them. They would work closely with Character GPT Agents and Structural GPT Agents to ensure that the conflicts drive the plot and character development.<br><br>Voice and Style GPT Agents: These agents could assist in refining the narrative voice and writing style of the story. They would help to ensure that the voice is consistent, engaging, and appropriate for the story's genre and target audience. They could also suggest stylistic techniques and devices to enhance the story's overall impact.<br><br>Editing and Revision GPT Agents: These agents would focus on improving the story's overall structure, pacing, and clarity. They could provide feedback on areas that may need tightening, expansion, or reorganization, as well as identifying inconsistencies or plot holes.<br><br>Remember that effective communication and collaboration among the different GPT agents will be crucial for the success of this project. Consider creating an overarching "Coordinator GPT Agent" that can manage the interactions between the various specialized agents and ensure that they're working together effectively and cohesively.<br><br>Overall, your plan for a multi-agent system to aid in creative writing is ambitious and has the potential to significantly enhance the writing process by providing specialized expertise in various aspects of storytelling.<br><br>

# Reflections

Most people find ChatGPT to be dry and repetetive. I can get more. Below are a few examples of the kind of writing I can get GPT to produce. 

Now imagine a swarm of them, all talking to each other, each given specific abilities, being expert in those specific abilities, all working towards a common goal that has been initialized by a user.

Some of it is very obviously AI written, but I’m pretty sure I’ve only scratched the surface of what’s possible here. And I think the swarm is going to just blow it’s power up. But I could be wrong. For now anyway. If GPT-3 (which is all I have access to right now for building an app) isn’t good enough for this to work well, this app will be ready once GPT4 or 4.5 or 5 become available.

I don’t know yet how well it would work. But if it works as well as I think it will, someone who knows a bit about writing and story could produce a publishable novel every 2 months, doing it part time.

Once I get the prototype done, I’m moving on to
* Film Scripts
* PhD Proposals
* Short Stories
* TV Show ideas/stories
* Any more ideas?

# Want to play?

I need test data. I’m working from my one story idea, and it’s really useful to have that. But it would be great if I could get a database of someone else’s completely different story idea too. I think my efforts are better spent working on the app though. For Now

If you want a db to play with, I could get you set up with a development test version of it, just for the data entry, there’s no GPT processing yet, and it's kinda ugly and tedious. But by the time your done, I should have the swarm ready to go, and it might be interesting to see where it goes?.

# Want to contribute?

That'd be cool! 

Currently *phusis* is a module in *myuz* which uses the *phusis* swarm to collaborate in creating stories.
